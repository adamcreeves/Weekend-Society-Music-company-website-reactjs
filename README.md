# WeekendSocietyMusic.com

This is the company website for [The Weekend Society](https://weekendsocietymusic.com) built by me, Adam Reeves.

This website was built using ReactJS which includes JavaScript, Html, and CSS.

You can create a blank React app to create a website like this, by using these commands in the terminal:

npm install -g create-react-app
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

I used Visual Studio Code as my code editor for this project.
